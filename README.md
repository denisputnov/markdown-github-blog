# React Blog

Hi. In this repo you can find my typescript ReactJS project. It is a blog. Function components gets info from github via custom React hooks. I choosed github as a data storabe because I seen such case on [web-standards.ru](https://web-standards.ru/). So, thats why I choosed github as a storage. I tryed to rework this case by myself to get some experience and I can guess, that my try is absolutely success.

Data tooks from here: [grnbows/markdown-github-blog-data](https://github.com/grnbows/markdown-github-blog-data)

### Usage
You can try my project online: [Markdown Github Blog](https://markdown-github-blog.vercel.app/)

Or, if you want to open my project localy in dev mode, just do this in your CLI: 
```
git clone https://github.com/grnbows/markdown-github-blog
yarn install
yarn start
```

App automatically opens http://localhost:3000 to view my project in browser.

Or use `yarn build` to build project localy.

### How does it look like?
